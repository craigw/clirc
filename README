CLIRC
=====

Commit Log => IRC because sometimes you're not allowed to edit the Subversion
post-commit hooks. Sigh.

Prerequisites
-------------

Get irccat: http://github.com/RJ/irccat
Set it up somewhere and change your /etc/hosts to point irc.local to it.

Setup
-----

Clone the repository. It'll live wherever you want it to.

mkdir ~/.clirc

# edit ~/.clirc/project.list
# format is [project_svn_root] [project name], eg:
# http://flot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ flot
# http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags jQuery UI

Add this to your crontab with the interval you'd like it to run at:

*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/env ruby /path/to/clirc/log_watcher.rb
